# Giving Tree App

###GivingTree - Lending made simple.


The Lady Hacks 2016 project made by @ariellam, @jiayi-zhou, @ivy-ruofan-xing and @roxelo.

The app allows users to keep track of what they are lending to people and to whom they owe something. Each user takes care of their own "karma" tree which grows or withers depending on the positive or negative transactions with others.

###Functionality

* Search and add your friends.

* Submit requests for IOUs and lend anything with a few short clicks.

* See your transaction history and add new transactions.

* Watch your tree grow with each completed request!
