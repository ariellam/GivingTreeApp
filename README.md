# Giving Tree App
This is a Lady Hacks 2016 project made by @ariellam, @jiayi-zhou, @ivy-ruofan-xing and @roxelo.

###Concept

The app allows users to keep track of what they are lending to people and to who they owe something. Based on your lending history, your tree can grow or die, thus allowing the user to know which friend is more reliable than an other.

###Functionality

* Search, add, see your friend's profile and tree.

* See your "transaction" history and add new "transactions."
